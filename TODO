= Runloop related

* Check TODOs in code about:
  * If I make the runloop run in the correct way: ((NSRunLoop mainRunLoop) runUntilDate:(NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.1))
  * If it plays nice when there's already a runloop, eg in a (iOS) app runner
* Clean/abstract the runloop related methods that keep the current-index and schedule the next to run etc

--------

* Clean up specs by classes
* Maybe make Should-not return a ShouldNot instance, so that the state of the original Should instance ins't negated? But this is mainly useful for meta-testing, like testing Bacon itself.
* Make Should-satisfy:block: use the body of the block if @object is a block?

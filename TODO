* Add Should-flunk and make an empty specification flunk
* Add Should-match which matches a string with a regexp
* Add Should-change which checks that the value increases after executing the block
* Maybe make Should-not return a ShouldNot instance, so that the state of the original Should instance ins't negated?
  But this is mainly useful for meta-testing, like testing Bacon itself.
* Execute the specs in a runloop and add the ability to delay the execution of assertions. So something like a `wait(seconds)' function

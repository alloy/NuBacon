* Make Should-be: and a: take a block and pass it on to satisfy:block:
* Add Should-flunk and make an empty specification flunk
* Add Should-match which matches a string with a regexp
* Add Should-change which checks that the value increases after executing the block
* Make (((do () (@ary objectAtIndex:0)) should) raise:"NSRangeException") work, so that is without quoting the list
* Execute the specs in a runloop and add the ability to delay the execution of assertions. So something like a `wait(seconds)' function

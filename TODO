* Maybe make Should-not return a ShouldNot instance, so that the state of the original Should instance ins't negated? But this is mainly useful for meta-testing, like testing Bacon itself.
* Make Should-satisfy:block: use the body of the block if @object is a block.
* Execute the specs in a runloop and add the ability to delay the execution of assertions. So something like a `wait(seconds)' function

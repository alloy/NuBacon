NuBacon -- small RSpec clone
============================

    "Truth will sooner come out from error than from confusion."
                                               ---Francis Bacon

NuBacon is a [Nu][nu] port of [Bacon][ba], a small [Ruby RSpec][rs] clone.

It is a [Behavior-Driven Development][bdd] test library for Nu and in
extension for Objective-C. It is being developed while using in our iOS
application, more on that will be announced.


Installation
------------

There's currently no Nu specific package manager, so you will have to
grab the source directly:

As a zip archive:

    $ curl https://github.com/alloy/NuBacon/zipball/0.1 -o NuBacon-0.1.zip
    $ unzip NuBacon-0.1.zip

Or as a git clone:

    $ git clone git@github.com:alloy/NuBacon.git
    $ cd NuBacon
    $ git checkout 0.1


Whirl-wind tour
---------------

    (load "bacon")

    (set beEmptyArray (do (object) (eq (object count) 0)))

    (describe "An array" `(
      (before (do ()
        (set @ary (NSArray array))
        (set @otherArray (`("noodles") array))
      ))

      (it "is empty" (do ()
        (((@ary should) not) containObject:1)
      ))

      (it "has zero elements" (do ()
        (((@ary count) should) be:0)
        (((((@ary count) should) not) be) closeTo:0.1) ; default delta of 0.00001
        ((((@ary count) should) be) closeTo:0.1 delta:0.2)
      ))

      (it "raises when trying to fetch an element" (do ()
        (((-> (@ary objectAtIndex:0)) should) raise:"NSRangeException")
      ))

      (it "compares to another object" (do ()
        ((@ary should) be:@ary)
        ((@ary should) equal:@ary)
        (((@otherArray should) not) be:@ary)
        (((@otherArray should) not) equal:@ary)
      ))

      ; Custom assertions are trivial to do, they are blocks returning
      ; a boolean value. The block is defined at the top.
      (it "uses a custom assertion to check if the array is empty" (do ()
        (@ary should:beEmptyArray)
        (((@otherArray) should) not:beEmptyArray)
      ))

      ; TODO
      ;it 'should have super powers' do
        ;should.flunk "no super powers found"
      ;end
    ))

    ($BaconSummary print)

Now run it:

    $ nush readme_spec.nu

    An array
    - is empty
    - has zero elements
    - raises when trying to fetch an element
    - compares to another object
    - uses a custom assertion to check if the array is empty

    5 specifications (11 requirements), 0 failures, 0 errors

Implemented assertions
----------------------

* should:<predicate>
* should equal:object
* should closeTo:<float | list of floats>
* should closeTo:<float | list of floats> delta:float
* should raise
* should raise:exceptionName
* should satisfy:message block:block


The block helper macro
----------------------

The raise and raise: assertions will execute the block, which is the
original object, and make sure that an exception is, or isn't, raised.

But creating a block and wrapping it in a BaconShould instance can
look a bit arcane, and you have to remember to use `send`:

    ((send (do () ((NSArray array) objectAtIndex:0)) should) raise:"NSRangeException")

Therefore the `->` macro has been introduced:

    (((-> ((NSArray array) objectAtIndex:0)) should) raise:"NSRangeException")


before/after
------------

before and after need to be defined before the first specification in
a context and are run before and after each specification.


Nested contexts
---------------

You can nest contexts, which will run before/after filters of parent
contexts like so:

    (describe "parent context" `(
      (describe "child context" `(
      ))
    ))

Shared contexts
---------------

You can define shared contexts in NuBacon like this:

    (shared "an empty container" `(
      (it "has size zero" (do ()
        (((@ary count) should) be:0)
      ))

      (it "is empty" (do ()
        (@ary should:beEmptyArray)
      ))
    ))

    (describe "A new array" `(
      (before (do ()
        (set @ary (NSArray array))
      )

      (behaves_like "an empty container")
    ))

These contexts are not executed on their own, but can be included with
behaves_like in other contexts.  You can use shared contexts to
structure suites with many recurring specifications.
